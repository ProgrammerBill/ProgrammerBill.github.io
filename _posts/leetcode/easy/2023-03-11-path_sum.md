# Path Sum

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

Example 3:

Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths


## C++ Solution

```c++
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        int newSum = targetSum - root->val;
        if (isLeaf(root) && newSum ==0 ) {
            return true;
        }
        return hasPathSum(root->left, newSum) ||
               hasPathSum(root->right, newSum);
    }
    bool isLeaf(TreeNode *node) {
        return node != nullptr &&
               node->left == nullptr && node->right == nullptr;
    }
```
