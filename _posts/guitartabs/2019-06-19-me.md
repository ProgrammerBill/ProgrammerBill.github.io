```
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful baby uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby that's the fun of me
Me ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you baby
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never want to see you walk away
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Living in winter I am your summer
Baby doll when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Me ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me
Hey kids
Spelling is fun
Girl there ain't no 'I' in team
But you know there is a 'Me'
Strike the band up 1 2 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl there ain't no 'I' in team
But you know there is a 'Me'
And you can't spell awesome without me
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me ooh
I'm the only one of me
I'm the only one of me
Baby that's the fun of me
Baby that's the fun of me
Me ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like
Me
Girl there ain't no 'I' in team
Ooh
But you know there is a 'Me'
I'm the only one of me
Baby that's the fun of me
Me
Strike the band up 1 2 3
Ooh
You can't spell awesome without me
You're the only one of you
Baby that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me
