[Verse 1]
G                  D    Em
I'm gonna pick up the pieces,
      D            G
and build a lego house
                 D            Em          D
when things go wrong we can knock it down
G                    D    Em
My three words have two meanings,
                  D      G
there's one thing on my mind
         D Em     D
It's all for you
 
[Pre-chorus]
G                                                     D       Em   D
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
    G                                            D           Em
If (you're) broken I'll mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
                D
that's raging on
 
[Chorus]
G                     D          Em
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                                G     D
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                  G/B             C             D				G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
G                     D          Em
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
                     G      D
I'll do it all for you in time
                  G/B         C                       D      G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
 
[Verse 2]
G                  D    Em
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
      D            G
and colour you in
                 D            Em          D
if things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall
G                    D    Em
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
	G		D			Em	
and I'll surrender up my heart
    D
and swap it for yours
 
[Chorus]
G                     D          Em
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                                G     D
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                  G/B         C                       D      G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
G                     D          Em
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
                     G      D
I'll do it all for you in time
                  G/B         C                       D      G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
 
[Bridge]
Em     D       C
Don't hold me down
             D                          C                D
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
 
[Pre-chorus]
G                                                     D       Em   D
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
    G                                            D           Em
and if you're broke I'll mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
                D
that's raging on
 
[Chorus]
G                     D          Em
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                                G     D
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                  G/B         C                       D      G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
G                     D          Em
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
                     G      D
I'll do it all for you in time
                  G/B         C                       D      G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
G                     D          Em
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                                G     D
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                  G/B         C                       D      G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
G                     D          Em
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
                     G      D
I'll do it all for you in time
                  G/B         C                       D      G
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
 
[Outro]
G                     D          Em
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                                G     D
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
                  G/B         C                    D      G
And out of all these things I've done I will love you better now
