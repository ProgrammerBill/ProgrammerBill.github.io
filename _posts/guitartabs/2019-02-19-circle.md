# 圆

```
A					B7
圆是美满 圆是那个令人甜蜜笑脸
E
圆是翩翩起舞转的圈圈
E/C#
转出一圈圈眷恋
A					B7
完是欠缺 完是那句令人难受再见
G#5
最怕最爱已经不会再见
C#m7
欢欣都只靠悼念
A				E   B
谁等 等 等 等不到月圆
B/G#		C#m7
谁怕 怕 怕 快乐快用完
A
可知有情人永远
B
结尾才是新的开端
A
情人团聚的小心愿
B
离开一段开一段新一段
B/G#
人间的圆虽则是不够缘
C#m7
而有生一天会遇见
A
成为遗憾的小心愿
B
诚心许愿一千段都甘愿
G#5
如果保存幸福一段
C#m7
这一段 都一样暖
A	B	 E
纵使谱不上美满的 圆的线
谁走 走 走 走出了乐园
谁痛 痛 痛 痛恨里复元
即使距离还太远
我信缘分安于身边
情人团聚的小心愿
离开一段开一段新一段
人间的圆虽则是不够缘
而有生一天会遇见
成为遗憾的小心愿
诚心许愿一千段都甘愿
如果保存幸福一段
这一段 都一样暖
纵使少一块缺了的圆圈
B/G#		C#m7
悲观的豁达点 给生命望更远
A
别介意永远差一点的欢笑
B
差一点的温暖差一点好好发展
小心愿 离开一段开一段新一段
人间的缘可绘画一个圆
从前那一些小缺陷会令世界美满点
仍然怀着的小心愿
求新一年多一年新一段
如果保存幸福一段
这一段 都一样暖
至少今天你欠缺的 明天见
```

# Wonderful You

```
I never knew
When the clock stopped and I'm looking at you
I never thought I'll miss someone like you
Someone I thought that I knew
I never knew
I should have known something wouldn't be true
Baby you know that I'm so into you
More than I know I should do
So why why why
Why should wewaited
And I I I
I should be waiting
Waiting for someone new
Even though that it wasn't you
But I know that it's
Wonderful
Incredible
Baby irrational
I never knew it was obsessional
And I never knew it was with you oooh
Baby if it's just
Wonderful
Incredible
Baby irrational
I never knew it was so sad
Just so sad
I'm so sorry
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me
Hmmm
（哼唱）
So why why why
Why should we waited
And I I I
I should be waiting
Waiting for someone new
Even though that it wasn't you
But I know that it's
Wonderful
Incredible
Baby irrational
I never knew it was obsessional
And I never knew it was with you oooh
Baby if it's just
Wonderful
Incredible
Baby irrational
I never knew it was so sad
Just so sad
I'm so sorry
Even now I just cannot feel you fall
I don't even know now
I'm sure you'll wait for me
Even now I just cannot deny
I just hold on so tight
Until you and I never could breathe
Oh
Wonderful
Incredible
Baby irrational
I never knew it was obsessional
And I never knew it was with you until you tell me to
Baby if it's just
Wonderful
Incredible
Baby irrational
I never knew it was so sad
Just so sad
I'm so sorry
Even now I just cannot feel you feel me
