```
[Verse 1]
           F                   G
I would be complex, I would be cool
             C                                   Am
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
                  F              G
And that would be okay for me to do
      C                                 Am
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you


[Pre-Chorus]
F
 I'd be a fearless leader
G
 I'd be an alpha type
C
 When everyone believes ya
Am
 What's that like?


[Chorus]
F                         G
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
C                                      Am
 Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
    F                          G
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
          C                 Am
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
           F   G
I'd be the man
           C   Am
I'd be the man


[Verse 2]
             F                   G
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
              C                                       Am
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
           F                 G
What I was wearing, if I was rude
             C                       Am
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves


[Pre-Chorus]
F                             G
 And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
C                   Am
 I'd be just like Leo in Saint Tropez


[Chorus]
F                         G
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
C                                      Am
 Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
    F                          G
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
          C                 Am
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
           F   G
I'd be the man
           C   Am
I'd be the man


[Bridge]
                             F
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
            G
And getting bitches and models?
             C
And it's all good if you're bad
          Am
And it's okay if you're mad
             F                             G
If I was out flashing my dollars, I'd be a bitch not a baller
                C
They'd paint me out to be bad
          Am
So, it's okay that I'm mad


[Chorus]
F                         G
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
C                                      Am
 Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
    F                          G
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
          C
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
     Am
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
F                         G
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
C                                      Am
 Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
    F                          G
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
          C                                  Am
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
           F   G
I'd be the man
           C       Am
I'd be the man (Oh)
           F         G
I'd be the man (Yeah)
           C   Am
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)


[Outro]
N.C.
If I was a man, then I'd be the man
