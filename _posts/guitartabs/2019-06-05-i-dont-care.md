G   Em   C    D
I’m at a party I don’t wanna be at
And I don’t ever wear a suit and tie,yeah
Wondering if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even looking me in my eyes
And then you take my hand, finish my drink, say shall we dance (hell yeah)
You know I love ya did I ever tell ya, you make it better like that

Don’t think I fit in at this party
Everyone’s got so much to say
I always feel like I’m nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway

Coz I don’t care when I’m with my baby yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I’m with my baby yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Coz I don’t care
long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere and you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I’m with my baby yeah

We at a party we don’t wanna be at
Tryna talk but we can’t hear ourselves
Read your lips I’d rather kiss ‘em right back
With all these people all around, I’m crippled with anxiety
But I’m told its where I’m supposed to be
You know what? It’s kind of crazy coz I really don’t mind
When you make it better like that

Don’t think we fit in at this party
Everyone’s got so much to say
When we walked in I said I’m sorry
But now I think that we should stay

Coz I don’t care when I’m with my baby yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I’m with my baby yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh, oh yeah yeah yeah)
Coz I don’t care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere and you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I’m with my baby yeah (oh oh oh oh, no)

I don’t like nobody but you
I hate everyone here
I don’t like nobody but you baby I don’t care
I don’t like nobody but you
I hate everyone here
I don’t like nobody but you baby yeah

Coz I don’t care (don’t care) when I’m with my baby yeah (oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (disappear)
And you making me feel that maybe I am somebody (maybe I’m somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (with the bad nights) when I’m with my baby yeah (ooh, ooh, ooh, oh yeah yeah yeah)
Coz I don’t care, as long as you just hold me near (me near)
You can take me anywhere (anywhere, anywhere) and you making me feel like I’m loved by somebody (loved by somebody yeah)
I can deal with the bad nights when I’m with my baby yeah (oh oh oh oh, no)
